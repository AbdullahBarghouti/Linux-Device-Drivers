2. Note that you won't need to unload the existing kernel network driver to run this program.  Give ashort explain what this might imply.
- The reason we dont need to unload the existing kernel network driver to run out userspace program is because when we use a userspace program with the system call mmap we create a new mapping in the virtual address space. With the new mapping in the virtual space, we can tell the kernel to look at this new address instead of the old/ existing kernel network driver. What we are doing is using different virtaul addresses to map to the same physical address, which removes the need to unload any existing kernel drivers.
